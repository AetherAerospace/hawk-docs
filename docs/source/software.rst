Software
========

    The Software part of the Hawk Project is split into
    three main parts, two of which reside in the same Repository
    on GitHub and one having its own seperate Repository.

    - `HAWK Flightcode <https://github.com/AetherAerospace/hawk-flightcode>`_
    - `HAWK Groundcode <https://github.com/AetherAerospace/hawk-groundcode>`_

Flightcode
^^^^^^^^^^

    This refers to the complete onboard logic that is flashed on the
    onboard ESP32-Microcontroller.

LoRa Transmit/Receive (lTRX)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    This Project uses LoRa to handle the communication between air and ground.
    For convenience we use the excellent prebuild LoRa Library by
    `sandeepmistry <https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa>`_
