We plan on building a autonomous aircraft with the capability to automatically fly to predefined waypoints.
Manual controls will be handled by a PS3-Controller attached to a LoRaWAN-ESP32. Communication to the aircraft runs
completely over said LoRaWAN.

  The PS3-Controller is mainly used due to ease of use and maybe because it's fun.

The Codebase is partly adpated from the HEAVY rocket project, but by now heavily modified to allow for more 
extensive LoRa Link Controls.

The Design is done completely from scratch and based on previous experience with our rockets. We primarly use onShape
and Fusion360 for the Design process and Blender for rendering.

  Flightime will be about 15-20 minutes, depending on how much we push the plane and weather conditions.
