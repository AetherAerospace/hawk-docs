In this project we plan on building a autonomous aircraft with the capability to automatically fly to predefined waypoints.
During the development phase, we will also implement manual controls using an PS3-Controler. 
The Controler will be mapped to the classic airplane videogame controls to make it a bit more fun and easy to use. 
We are currently aiming for a flighttime of 10-15 minutes.
