Hardware
========

    The Hardware part resides in one main repo and mostly contains the finished
    stl's,3mf and step files directly out of Blender, OnShape and Fusion360.

Design Considerations
---------------------

    Our designs are based on current and past experiences we made with
    flying objects and aerodynamic design.

Size
----

    The size is mostly determined by the decision to use two engines and the rotor-circumference.

Weight
------

    Will be added after printing and assembly is finished. Estimates based on experiences and slicer previews lie below 1.5 kg. 

Aerodynamics
------------

Aerodynamic Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    :Wing configuration:
        :Number:
            Monoplane 
            1)

        :Positioning:
            Mid wing
            1)

        :Bracing:
            Potentially wire braced, come back after assembly.

        :Aspect ration:
            Moderate
            2)

        :Chord variation along span:
            Tapered
            2)

        :Wing sweep:
            Swept
            2)

        :Dihedral/Anhedral:
            Dihedral, 5Â° overall, Dihedral tips and winglets
            1)

        :Body form:
            Blended body

        2
         .. image:: /img/aerodynamics/wings_top.JPG
            :align: center

        
    
    :Wing-Wash:
        The outer parts of the wings are tilted downwards. This allows for better roll-controls in high AoA (Angle of Attack) or stalls.

Concept Trailer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    AETHER HAWK started with a concept trailer build and animated in early september 2022. The idea behind this design was reusing the old AETHER HEAVY rocket as engine and build the aircraft around it. This design was completely modeled and designed in Blender (except for the AETHER HEAVY Rocket itself). Even thou this design was purely thought to be an inspiration and motivation it already had some aerodynamic decisions implemented that ended up being reused in the current design.
