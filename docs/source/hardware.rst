Hardware
========

    The Hardware part resides in one main repo and mostly contains the finished
    stl's,3mf and step files directly out of Blender, OnShape and Fusion360.

    - `HAWK Hardware <https://github.com/AetherAerospace/hawk-hardware>`_

Size
----

    The size is mostly determined by the decision to use two engines and 
    the rotor-circumference.

Aerodynamics
------------

Aerodynamic Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:**Wing configuration**:

    - Number

        Monoplane 

    - Positioning

        Mid wing

    - Bracing

        Potentially wire braced, come back after assembly.

    - Aspect ration

        Moderate

    - Chord variation along span

        Tapered

    - Wing sweep

        Swept

    - Dihedral/Anhedral

        Dihedral, 5Â° overall, Dihedral tips and winglets

    - Body form

        Blended body

        .. image:: /img/aerodynamics/wings_top.JPG
            :align: center

:**Wing-Wash**:

    The outer parts of the wings are tilted downwards. This allows for better 
    roll-controls in high AoA (Angle of Attack) or stalls.

:**Center of Gravity**:

    Calculating the center of gravity is not effective because the infill of the individual parts is not consistent. In order to solve this problem, the center of gravity can be shifted by moving the battery pack. We can still estimate the center of gravity to be inside an expectable range close to the center of lift. Adding the FTS will also further influence the center of gravity.

:**Body form**:

    The engine block uses a blended body design. This means that there is no clear cut between wing and body. The engine body is designed in a way that contributes to lift production. There are large, non-lift producing objects, manly the tail, therefore the design is not a flying wing.

Assembly
--------

Assembly methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  We connect the individual parts by "welding" the 3d printed parts together. Using a soldering iron, the connecting surfaces are melted together. Any irregularities caused by this method are removed using sandpaper.

  An alternative to this approach is using plastic glue. We use Revels Contact Provisional Glue. Downsides to both methods are the emerging fumes.

  Whilst the engine block, tail and wing mounds are entirely 3d printed, the wings are made using a "skeleton" and foil. This minimizes potential repair times and costs. We do see structural failure of the 3d printed parts as a risk, given the structural integrity and weight of the parts.

Assembly pictures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Will be added after assembly is complected and pictures are taken.

Concept Trailer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AETHER HAWK started with a concept trailer build and animated in early september 2022. 
The idea behind this design was reusing the old AETHER HEAVY rocket as engine and build 
the aircraft around it. This design was completely modeled and designed in Blender 
(except for the AETHER HEAVY Rocket itself). Even thou this design was purely thought 
to be an inspiration and motivation it already had some aerodynamic decisions implemented 
that ended up being reused in the current design.
